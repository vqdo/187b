        <img class="photo-large" src="assets/img/registration.jpg" alt="Conference registration">        

            <p>The Financial Horizons Conference is Southern California’s premier networking and education event for students looking to break into finance and professionals seeking to recruit new talent. Held every year at UCSD’s Rady School of Management, the conference brings together hundreds of students, professionals, and alumni for an exciting day of networking and education. Students are invited to participate in six interactive workshops led by distinguished professionals from a myriad of financial industries including investment banking, private equity, venture capital, accounting and more. The conference also proffers a large networking session in which attendees are given the opportunity to consort with hundreds of peers from across the nation and as far away as Canada.</p>
