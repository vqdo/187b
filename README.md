## Important Note
We are on an accelerated timeline because our client needs the basic functioning site by Week 7. Professor Kirsh granted us permission to combine our actual page implementations with wireframes for the pages we haven't yet finished.

This site most likely will not work locally. To view our site and the corresponding wireframes, please navigate to http://uis.victoriado.com/app on a modern browser.

While the site should be functional, we have not done thorough testing yet. Please contact Victoria Do (victoriado@outlook.com) if there are any significant issues. 

## Site Location
http://uis.victoriado.com/app

## Site Map
Our site architecture is flat. "WF" indicates that the page links to an Axure wireframe. We have no sub-pages.
